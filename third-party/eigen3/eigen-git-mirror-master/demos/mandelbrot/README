*** Mandelbrot demo ***

Controls:
* Left mouse button to center view at a point.
* Drag vertically with left mouse button to zoom in and out.

Be sure to enable SSE2 or AltiVec to improve performance.

The number of iterations, and the choice between single and double precision, are
determined at runtime depending on the zoom level.
