#ifdef PADDLE_MOBILE_USE_OPENMP
/**
 * android-ndk-r17 has a problem when linking with openmp.
 * if paddle-mobile enables -fopenmp, but didn't use those omp_* functions,
 * after linking another binary with libpaddle-mobile.so, the omp_get_thread_num
 * will not work. see test/common/test_openmp.cc the detailed reason is still
 * unclear, but this trick will work. a better solution is hacking the linker,
 * try some flags to make it link omp_* functions, but I didn't find out how to
 * make it work.
